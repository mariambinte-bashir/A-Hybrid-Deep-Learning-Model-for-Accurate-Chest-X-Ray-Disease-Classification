## Paper Title: A Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Accurate Chest X-Ray Disease Classification

### Paper ID:
- 271

---

## üß† Project Overview

This project focuses on the classification of chest X-ray images to enable the automatic diagnosis of respiratory diseases such as **COVID-19**, **pneumonia**, and other abnormalities. 

The system integrates **custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with **Vision Transformers (ViTs)** including:
- Tiny-ViT
- Swin Transformer
- FocalNet
- VOLO

These models are compared under limited data constraints to evaluate their performance in medical image classification.

Advanced **data augmentation** and **regularization** techniques are employed to enhance generalization and robustness. Our custom CNN achieved **98.29% accuracy**, while the Vision Transformer **VOLO-D1** reached **98%**, outperforming other models.

The system utilizes **transfer learning** and integrates **focal modulation mechanisms** (via FocalNet) to replace traditional self-attention modules and improve feature representation.
